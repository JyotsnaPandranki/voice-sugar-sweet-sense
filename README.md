## 📌 Project Overview

This is a demo web application that simulates a voice-driven interface for healthcare. The goal is to demonstrate how we might integrate voice input with a Machine Learning model to assess diabetes risk. The model considers glucose level and weather-related data to determine whether a user might be diabetic.
